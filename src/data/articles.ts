        title: "Today Tech News Updates",
        content: "Admitting that it is not easy to detect and remove accounts belonging to people under the age of 13, Facebook has said that it is looking at ways to convince people under age 13 to not lie about their age, including using artificial intelligence (AI) technology. \n\n In keeping with these realities, the “digitalization of everything” is associated with stark and increasing labor market and geographical divides. To begin with, the wage premium for digital skills (highlighted above) has nearly doubled since 2002. That means that the mean pay of workers in higher-level digital occupations (about $73,000) now more than doubles the $30,000 wage of low-digital workers. This is labor market polarization at work.\n\n Likewise, our data highlight extraordinary patterns of over- and under-representation of various gender and ethnic groups across occupational groups, in part but not exclusively driven by those groups’ digital skills. Take a look below how women—despite having slightly higher mean digital scores—remain heavily under-represented in highly digital computer and engineering occupations (but over-represented in office admin, education, and health occupations). Likewise, blacks are overrepresented in medium-digital occupations like office support and health care support, while Hispanics are greatly underrepresented in highly digital tech positions and overrepresented in low-digital domains such as farming, construction, and building and grounds maintenance.",

        title: "Difference Between Coding and Programming?",
        content: "It took me a long time to understand what the terms programming and coding really meant, and what each field entailed. And I'm sure I'm not the only one who felt confused by those two terms when I was new to tech.\n\n For a while I thought that they were the same thing, and it took me some time to understand that there are differences between the two 'worlds'. \n\n In this article, I'll explain the basic differences between coding and programming and how they work collaboratively to develop apps and sites.\n\n So let’s explore these terms and how professionals use them by first understanding what they mean.",

        title: "Understanding AI",
        content: "The number of districts that trained teachers on generative artificial intelligence more than doubled from 2023 to 2024, according to a new analysis by the research and policy firm RAND Corp.\n\n In the fall of 2024, 48 percent of districts reported they had trained teachers on AI use—up from 23 percent in the fall of 2023. RAND surveyed about 300 districts in 2024 and about 200 in 2023 and weighted their responses to make them representative of all public school districts.\n\n If districts follow their plans for the current school year, nearly three-quarters will have provided AI training to educators by the fall of 2025.",

        title: "Trends in global capital",
        content: "In the decade before the COVID-19 pandemic, foreign capital flows to China were extremely strong over a period of many years. This held for foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio, and other investment flows and looks to be reversing in the years since the pandemic. Portfolio and other investment flows to China look especially weak, while they are at the stronger end of the historical range for the rest of emerging markets (EM).\n\n The interesting question is why this decoupling is happening, something that is obviously hard to infer from flows. This post looks separately at FDI, portfolio, and other investment flows around key events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the start of President Donald Trump’s second term. The fall in FDI flows to China is part of a longer-running trend that has been ongoing for many years. The drop in portfolio flows to China is related to the start of Trump’s second term, while the fall in other investment flows to China seems to line up with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It goes without saying that none of this is conclusive and is something we will return to in a future post.",

        title: "Steps toward AI",
        content: "Rapid advances in the sophistication and functionality of military platforms enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) make it necessary and urgent to minimize the likelihood that states will use them in ways that cause harm to civilians. Of particular concern is the possibility that AI-powered military capabilities might cause harm to whole societies and put in question the survival of the human species.\n\n China and the United States are the leaders of AI development and diffusion, and so their governments have a special responsibility to seek to prevent uses of AI in the military domain from harming civilians. They can achieve this together by pursuing mechanisms believed to reduce the likelihood that AI-powered military crises will occur. This is the goal of governance regimes. The United States and China can also seek to protect civilians in an AI-powered military crisis by implementing mechanisms believed to reduce the consequences of those crises, if they do occur. This is the goal of preparedness regimes (Figure 1).\n\n Governance regimes can seek to address technical and use-based causes of AI-powered military crises by requiring or prohibiting certain behaviors. Mechanisms can range from mutual statements to binding agreements and confidence-building measures that enhance communication and transparency. For such governance measures to be durable and effective, they must be based upon a mutually acceptable, analytical method for determining what to seek to govern.",

        title: "Economic development",
        content: "In a companion report released earlier this year, we outlined why land use policies and practices—which have long been contentious and high stakes—are getting more scrutiny. We offered a rubric for conducting equity impact assessments of proposed projects and significant land use changes, such as rezoning, that often accompany them. This report extends that work, showing why and how land use tools should be upgraded (and integrated with other tools) to promote more inclusive and effective economic development—i.e., economic change that generates shared gains, including racial and social equity. Our goal is to encourage and inform a new generation of progress in local economies both large and small.\n\n Across the country, there is broad-based interest in expanding good jobs, growing small and midsized businesses with local and diverse ownership, and making local economies and tax bases more resilient to shifts in trade policy, significant cuts in federal and state funding, and losses from extreme weather and other impacts of a changing climate. But the right steps for achieving the gains without displacing residents, making the cost of living even more unaffordable, or otherwise exacerbating inequality by race, class, or other traits are not always clear, especially for local decisionmakers in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors.",
